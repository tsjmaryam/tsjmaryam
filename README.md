I'm a Business Analytics graduate from **The George Washington University**, driven by a passion for  machine learning , ethical AI, and solving complex real-world problems through data. With a multidisciplinary background in marketing, fitness entrepreneurship, and analytics, I combine technical skills with strategic insight to create impactful, data-informed solutions.

##  What I'm Passionate About
- Designing **interpretable and bias-aware ML models** using SHAP, EBM, and AIR  
- Building scalable, real-time forecasting tools using **Python**, **SQL**, and **cloud technologies**  
- Exploring **CECL (Current Expected Credit Loss)** frameworks to develop responsible credit risk models  
- Bridging **data science and business strategy** through visualization and experimentation  
- Applying the **discipline and resilience** I’ve developed through years of **weightlifting and coaching** to my work in analytics

## Featured Projects

- **[Explainable AI Chatbot for Alert Analysis](https://github.com/tsjmaryam/FraudLens-AI-Chatbot)**  
  Built an award-winning, Streamlit-based decision-support tool using interpretable machine-learning models (EBM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to help analysts understand key drivers behind alerts, justify model outputs, and prioritize reviews more effectively—reducing manual review time by ~30%.

- **[Capital Bikeshare Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/tsjmaryam/Capital-Bikeshare-Demand-Forecasting)**  
  Developed LASSO and Ridge regression models to forecast daily bike demand, supporting operational planning and improving resource allocation accuracy (~85% R²).

- **[Risk & Forecasting Analytics Project](https://github.com/tsjmaryam/CECL_Federal-Reserve-Bank-of-St.-Louis-)**  
  Built a forecasting framework in R using ARIMAX models and macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment, housing prices) to support scenario analysis and stress testing in regulated environments.

- **[Fair Lending & Bias-Aware Modeling](https://github.com/tsjmaryam/RML--Group-6)**  
  Developed interpretable models using EBM and SHAP to evaluate and remediate bias in decision outcomes, balancing model performance with transparency and fairness considerations.

- **[Iowa Liquor Sales Market Entry Analysis](https://github.com/tsjmaryam/Iowa-Liquor-Sales-Analysis-for-Market-Entry)**  
  Built an end-to-end SQL and Python analytics pipeline on AWS with Power BI dashboards to identify demand patterns, underserved regions, and growth opportunities for retail expansion.
