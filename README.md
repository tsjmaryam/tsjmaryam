 
#  Hello, I'm Maryam Shahbaz Ali

I'm a Business Analytics graduate student at **The George Washington University**, driven by a passion for **machine learning**, **ethical AI**, and solving complex real-world problems through data. With a multidisciplinary background in marketing, fitness entrepreneurship, and analytics, I combine technical skills with strategic insight to create impactful, data-informed solutions.

##  What I'm Passionate About
- Designing **interpretable and bias-aware ML models** using SHAP, EBM, and AIR  
- Building scalable, real-time forecasting tools using **Python**, **SQL**, and **cloud technologies**  
- Exploring **CECL (Current Expected Credit Loss)** frameworks to develop responsible credit risk models  
- Bridging **data science and business strategy** through visualization and experimentation  
- Applying the **discipline and resilience** I’ve developed through years of **weightlifting and coaching** to my work in analytics

##  Skills & Tools

**Languages & Platforms**  
`Python` • `R` • `SQL` • `PostgreSQL` • `AWS` • `Apache Spark`

**Visualization**  
`Power BI` • `ggplot2` • `SAS Visual Analytics`

**Analytics & Modeling**  
- Supervised ML: `Regression`, `SVM`, `LASSO`, `Ridge`  
- Explainable ML: `SHAP`, `EBM`, `Post Hoc Explanation`  
- Statistics: `ANOVA`, `A/B Testing`, `Forecasting`  
- Financial Modeling: CECL components (`PD`, `LGD`, `EAD`)
